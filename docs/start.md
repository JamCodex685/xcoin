You can also use the yarn command directly, both have the same effect

Use the `--paper` flag to decide whether to trade live or paper.

Use the `--trade_type` flag to identify how the trading bot will trade, including

- auto automatic trading

- autoBuy buy automatically

- autoSell automatically sell

- manual

Use the `--conf` flag to identify the configuration file used by the trading robot, which will override the `conf-base.js` configuration file

The following command will trade the settings under the specified configuration file

```bash
yarn trade binance --conf ./data/config/binance/30mf.json
```

For more transaction parameters that can be brought by the command line, please refer to the commands/trade.js file. All transaction references can be set directly in the config file
